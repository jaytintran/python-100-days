## Coffee Machine

- This is the 16th day's project of making a coffee machine like the 15th day. But in this challenge, I had to use OOP paradigm in Python ie. Classes, objects, methods & attributes.
- This project serves as a foundation of OOP in general. And also to pratice Python programming specically.
